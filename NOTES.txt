Starting a new project. It's kinda hard to get off the ground with node. Use npm install. Installed chai and mocha as dev dependencies and for production: webpack, react.

Need to decide what kind of database to have. Either a relational or data. SQL or Mongo. Might be some relationships between ingredients, but the main relationship will be the glass. I don't feel like it would benefit from having a relational database.

Need to get Babel working. Think I did it with webpack last time. See if I can get it separate from webpack.

Pretty easy. Just install babel-cli and a preset and you're good to go.
